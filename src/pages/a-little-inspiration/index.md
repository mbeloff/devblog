I usually post only about Bob on this page but this fb post by Ryan Stephens is so spot on...a bit of gold to share with my students and it’s what Bob was about anyway...forget perfection and keep painting, and remember the most important thing is that it makes you feel happy!
ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE HAPPY. ❤️
