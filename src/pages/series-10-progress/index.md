Season 10...a few more done. Some friends are joining me this year and also painting every painting from Bobs tv series...all 403 of them

<!-- end -->

 If anyone else is interested in doing this...hereâ€™s my two bobâ€™s worth ðŸ˜‰...I paint small, almost every day, and find a way to accept EVERYTHING. You improve and learn without even noticing, mistakes and failures are part of the deal, just like in life anyway. Twoinchbrush.com is the best source of all you need...all his paintings shown in thumbnails with colour lists and Bobs videos to paint along with.
Feel free to pm me if you want more info..if I canâ€™t help, I probably know someone else who can. Happy painting 2020!
