Started series 10...double digits...a happy little milestone!

<!-- end -->

However...having a major blah time today that even Bob couldnâ€™t talk me out of...my painting was looking rather blah too, so of all the things that I could choose from, to turn my blah into a happy accident, I add a cabin...and I hate Bobs cabins!!!! Go figure hey? This is just so out of character that itâ€™s tickling my funny bone and Iâ€™m feeling rather cheerful after all..I do like it when life grins and winks at me.
The paintingâ€™s no better but I feel great ðŸ˜‚
