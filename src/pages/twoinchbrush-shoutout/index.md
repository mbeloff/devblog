Thought I’d share this wonderful link which I use all the time.

[TwoInchBrush](https://www.twoinchbrush.com) is a database listing all Bob Ross paintings from his tv series and has lots of other helpful info...eg a one hour tutorial. A really great feature is a small thumbnail of every painting...you click on it and it brings up the tv episode you want to watch and maybe paint along with or just listen to if you’re feeling stressed...there’s something very soothing about his voice.
