Will be teaching this at my next class. A quiet painting..Bobâ€™s first seascape in the series from season 1...

<!-- end -->

 The paint application for this one is nice and straightforward, but for a happy result, this painting asks for thoughtfulness about placement of the different elements that make up the composition...I found myself quieting down as I painted it..almost a meditation, a centering. Love this one. ðŸ’œ
