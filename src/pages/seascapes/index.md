Working through season 9...used Bob’s newly arrived liquid clear today...very tricky, can’t picture students managing even the very thinnest coat. I’ve used a substitute medium when I ran out of Bob’s product and found that it works brilliantly, much better than Bob’s.
Still have plenty of time before I teach a seascape..thank goodness..I’ll be churning them out before then...picture a seascape factory! That’s me. 💜

Seascapes from series 1-9...going to focus on them for a while...feeling the need for it...to connect with their particular kind of mystery and beauty.
