Series 8 so far. Discovered my next challenge - the colours in Bob’s foliage...

<!-- end -->

Bob makes use of a wide range of colour as he taps in highlights over an initial dark base for bushes and trees.
BOB...”And how about, how about we take some sap green and add a bit of cad yellow to it...and shoot let’s add some indian yellow and yellow ochre and maybe, maybe even a bit of bright red on the same ole dirty brush and the highlights’ll just sparkle out onto those bushes in all kinds of beautiful colours.”
ME...looks at muddy brown brush...😩
