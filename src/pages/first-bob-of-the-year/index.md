First daily Bob of the year...

<!-- end -->

It was painted yesterday on our home balcony. There are days when I can’t make it to the studio..life happens..so I keep a painting kit at home in one of those big plastic storage containers from a hardware store. It fits nicely into a wardrobe. Being an early riser, I can easily paint at least one on those days.

“A change is as good as a holiday.” said the cat as it wiped down the table with the old woman.
