“Imagination is one of the most important things you can possess. So develop your imagination...

<!-- end -->

It’s like any other muscle in the body..use it, exercise it, practise with it. You’ll be amazed at what you can imagine. Pretty soon, if you paint, you become very aware of nature, you become aware of colour and you’re riding down the street and you see a beautiful tree and you say, Oh look at the sap green or the white in the cloud that’s made with a fan brush. You have to be careful though...you get so interested in all the beautiful things that nature has...you drive right off the road!”
Bob Ross quote from series 9 episode 13
